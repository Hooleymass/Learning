# How a Shell Works
A shell is a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. It interprets commands entered by the user and passes them to the operating system to be executed. The shell acts as an intermediary between the user and the kernel.

# PID and PPID
- PID (Process ID) is a unique identifier assigned to a process when it is created.
- PPID (Parent Process ID) is the PID of the process that created the process. Every process except init (process with PID 1) has a parent process.

# Manipulating the Environment of the Current Process
Environment variables can be manipulated in a shell through the use of the `export` and `unset` commands. The environment of a process can also be manipulated programmatically through functions such as `getenv` and `setenv`.

# Function vs System Call
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task and returns control to the caller. Functions are called from within a program and are executed in the same process as the calling program. A system call is a request made by a program to the operating system's kernel to perform a specific task, such as creating a process or reading from a file. System calls involve a switch from user-mode to kernel-mode and back.

# Creating Processes
Processes can be created in a shell using the `fork` and `exec` system calls. The `fork` system call creates a copy of the current process, while the `exec` system call replaces the current process image with a new process image specified as an argument.

# Three Prototypes of main
The three prototypes of the `main` function are:


```
int main(void)
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
```


# Shell and PATH
The shell uses the PATH environment variable to find the programs that are executed. The PATH is a list of directories separated by colons (:) and the shell searches each directory in the PATH for the program specified in the command line.

# Executing Another Program with execve
The `execve` system call can be used to execute another program from within a process. The `execve` system call takes as arguments the path of the program to be executed, an array of arguments, and an array of environment variables.

# Suspending Execution of a Process
The `wait` system call can be used to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children terminates. The `wait` system call returns the exit status of the terminated child process.

# EOF (End-of-File)
EOF (End-of-File) is a condition that occurs when there is no more data to be read from a file. In a shell, the `EOF` signal can be generated by typing `ctrl + d`.
